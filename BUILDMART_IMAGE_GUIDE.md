# 🏗️ BuildMart Image Creation Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete

I've created a comprehensive image organization system for your BuildMart project:

### 📁 New Folder Structure
```
public/
└── projects/
    ├── buildmart-hero.jpg           # ✅ Main project image (updated path)
    ├── buildmart-mockup.html        # ✅ Interactive dashboard for screenshots
    ├── buildmart-image-spec.md      # ✅ AI generation specifications
    └── README.md                    # ✅ Organization guide
```

### 🎯 Updated Project Data
