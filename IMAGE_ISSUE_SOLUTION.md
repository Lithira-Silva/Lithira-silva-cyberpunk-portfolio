# BuildMart Image Issue Resolution

## 🔍 Problem Identified
- All project images in `/public/` are only 33 bytes (essentially empty files)
- This is why BuildMart image isn't showing - the file exists but has no content

## ✅ Immediate Solution

I've created a temporary fix. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Use the Image Generator (Recommended)
1. Open `generate-buildmart-image.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download BuildMart Image" 
3. Save the downloaded file as `buildmart-hero.jpg` in `/public/` folder
4. Replace the existing empty file

### Option 2: Use a Placeholder Service
You can temporarily use a placeholder service by updating the image path:

```typescript
image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800/000000/00FFFF?text=BuildMart+Construction+Management'
```

### Option 3: Create Your Own Image
1. Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva)
2. Create a 1200x800px image
3. Use dark background with cyan accents
4. Save as `buildmart-hero.jpg` in `/public/` folder

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ Project data updated to use `/buildmart-hero.jpg`
- ✅ Path structure correct
- ❌ Image file is empty (needs replacement)

## 📱 Next Steps
1. Replace the empty image file with actual content
2. Refresh the browser
3. BuildMart image should appear on both pages
